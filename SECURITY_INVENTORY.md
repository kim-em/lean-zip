# Security Inventory

Living inventory of trusted components, boundary-facing subsystems, and
known gaps that sit outside the formally verified codec core.

## Status Labels

- `proved-in-repo`: covered by Lean proofs in this repository
- `guarded-locally`: not fully proved, but protected by explicit checks and limits
- `tested-only`: covered by tests/conformance but missing stronger assurance
- `upstream-risk`: trusted dependency with a known or suspected upstream issue

## Trusted Computing Base

### Lean Runtime: `ByteArray`, scalar-array allocation, `IO`

- Status: `upstream-risk`
- Why trusted: all Lean code ultimately relies on runtime allocation and
  `IO` primitives for `ByteArray`, `Handle.read`, and stream operations.
- Current local guardrails:
  - `Zip/Archive.lean` checks `n.toUSize.toNat == n` before `Handle.read`
  - `Zip/Archive.lean` checks file-bounds for central directory before reading it
  - native inflate APIs carry explicit `maxOutputSize` bounds
- Known concern:
  - crafted oversized reads can become runtime-allocation hazards if
    unchecked sizes reach `Handle.read`
  - the April 2026 report against Lean runtime allocation/read paths is
    exactly the kind of risk this inventory must track
- Missing work:
  - prove or enforce stronger preconditions before every `Handle.read`
    and `Stream.read` driven by archive metadata
  - add regression fixtures for oversized ZIP64 size claims

### zlib via C FFI

- Components: [c/zlib_ffi.c](/home/kim/lean-zip/c/zlib_ffi.c:1)
- Status: `guarded-locally`
- Why trusted: whole-buffer and streaming compression/decompression are
  implemented in C and depend on zlib plus libc allocation behavior.
- Current local guardrails:
  - `UINT_MAX` guards on whole-buffer input sizes
  - overflow-aware buffer growth helpers
  - explicit `max_output` check in whole-buffer decompression
  - state finalizers for streaming objects
- Missing work:
  - maintain sanitizer coverage for all FFI entry points
  - add dedicated malformed-input regression tests for streaming paths
  - audit all formatted error and allocation helpers after any C changes

### `Zip.Native.Inflate` and verified DEFLATE core

- Status: `proved-in-repo`
- Components:
  - [Zip/Native/Inflate.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Native/Inflate.lean:1)
  - [Zip/Spec/InflateCorrect.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Spec/InflateCorrect.lean:1)
  - [Zip/Spec/DeflateRoundtrip.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Spec/DeflateRoundtrip.lean:1)
- Notes:
  - this is the strongest-assurance part of the repo
  - remaining risk comes from framing, parser boundaries, runtime, and limits

## Boundary-Facing Subsystems

### ZIP Archive Reader/Extractor

- Components: [Zip/Archive.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Archive.lean:1)
- Status: `guarded-locally`
- Trust boundary:
  - parses EOCD, central directory, ZIP64 metadata, local headers, names,
    offsets, compressed sizes, and extraction paths from untrusted files
- Current guardrails:
  - central directory must fit within file size
  - configurable `maxCentralDirSize`
  - local `readExact` checks `Nat -> USize` roundtrip before `Handle.read`
  - `assertSpanInFile` validates local-header, name+extra, and compressed-data
    spans against actual file size before each attacker-controlled `Handle.read`
    in `readEntryData`
  - regression fixture `testdata/zip/malformed/oversized-compressed-size.zip`
    exercises the oversized-compressedSize rejection path
  - path traversal blocked via `Binary.isPathSafe`
  - CRC and final size checked after extraction
- Missing work:
  - add explicit mismatch checks between central and local metadata where useful
  - add oversized ZIP64 regression fixtures and fuzzing for metadata parsing
  - prove bounded-read lemmas for the guarded read paths if tractable

### Tar Parser/Extractor

- Components: [Zip/Tar.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Tar.lean:1)
- Status: `guarded-locally`
- Trust boundary:
  - parses tar headers, GNU long-name records, PAX metadata, symlinks,
    and streamed entry contents
- Current guardrails:
  - explicit `maxEntrySize` in extraction paths
  - path safety checks for extracted files
  - short-read detection in entry and padding reads
  - invalid PAX UTF-8 is skipped instead of panicking in `parsePaxRecords`
- Missing work:
  - review all `String.fromUTF8!` callsites reachable from untrusted archives
  - add malformed PAX and GNU-longname fuzz/fixture coverage

#### Symlink/hardlink extraction policy

`Tar.extract` (in [Zip/Tar.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Tar.lean:1))
applies a fixed per-typeflag policy:

- `typeRegular` ('0') and `typeDirectory` ('5') — written under
  `outDir/path` after `Binary.isPathSafe` rejects unsafe paths
  (absolute, `..`, `.`, empty components, backslash, Windows drive
  letters).
- `typeSymlink` ('2') — `linkname` is rejected before any
  `Handle.createSymlink` call if it starts with `/`, contains `\`, or
  has any `..` component (path-component split). The payload is
  always discarded.
- `typeHardlink` ('1') — silently skipped. No filesystem entry is
  created, the payload is consumed and discarded, and no
  `Handle.createHardlink` call exists in the extractor. A crafted
  `linkname` therefore cannot escape `outDir`.
- All other typeflags (devices, FIFO, GNU sparse, etc.) — same silent
  skip as `typeHardlink`.

Regression fixtures live under `testdata/tar/security/`:

- `tar-slip.tar`, `tar-absolute.tar` — regular-file entries that must
  fail `"unsafe path"`.
- `backslash-slip.tar` — regular-file entry whose path contains `\`;
  also fails `"unsafe path"` (the backslash check fires before the
  `..` component check).
- `symlink-slip.tar` — symlink whose linkname contains `..`; must
  fail `"unsafe symlink"`.
- `symlink-absolute.tar` — symlink whose linkname is `/etc/passwd`;
  must fail `"unsafe symlink"`. Built deterministically by
  `scripts/build-symlink-hardlink-malformed-fixtures.lean`.
- `hardlink-outside.tar` — `typeHardlink` entry with linkname
  `../outside`; extraction must succeed with an empty extract dir.
  Built by the same script.

### Gzip/Zlib/Raw DEFLATE Public APIs

- Components:
  - [Zip/Gzip.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Gzip.lean:1)
  - [Zip/Basic.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Basic.lean:1)
  - [Zip/RawDeflate.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/RawDeflate.lean:1)
- Status: `guarded-locally`
- Current guardrails:
  - decompression APIs expose `maxDecompressedSize` or native equivalents
  - malformed fixture coverage already exists for some gzip/zip/tar cases
- Missing work:
  - inventory all call sites using unlimited decompression (`0 = no limit`)
  - decide whether all public extraction APIs should default to bounded mode
  - add sanitizer-backed regression coverage for streaming decode paths

## Known Immediate Audit Targets

### 1. ZIP metadata to `Handle.read`

- File: [Zip/Archive.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Archive.lean:341)
- Concern:
  - `readExact` itself guards `Nat -> USize`, but callers still need proof
    or validation that attacker-controlled sizes are file-bounded before reading
- Needed:
  - explicit pre-read checks against file size and local header span
  - malformed ZIP64 fixtures

### 2. Tar UTF-8 partial functions

- File: [Zip/Tar.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Tar.lean:216)
- Concern:
  - `String.fromUTF8!` is partial and should not be reachable from
    attacker-controlled invalid bytes without prior validation
- Needed:
  - callsite audit plus tests covering invalid path/name encodings

### 3. Unlimited decompression knobs

- Files:
  - [Zip/Basic.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Basic.lean:9)
  - [Zip/Archive.lean](/home/kim/lean-zip/Zip/Archive.lean:386)
- Concern:
  - `0 = no limit` is convenient but weak as a default for hostile inputs
- Needed:
  - policy decision on safer defaults for archive extraction APIs
  - tests for decompression-bomb limits

## Required Maintenance Rule

Whenever a new parser, extraction path, FFI helper, or streaming API is
added, this file must be updated in the same change set with:

- trust status
- guardrails
- known missing work
- regression references if a bug prompted the change
