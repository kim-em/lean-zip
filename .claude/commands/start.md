# Start Autonomous Work

Follow the Autonomous Work Cycle in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

1. Orient — read PROGRESS.md, PLAN.md, VERIFICATION.md
2. Plan — decide session type, write/update PLAN.md
3. Execute — implement, review, or self-improve
4. Verify — final build+test, review diff, /second-opinion
5. Document — append session entry to PROGRESS.md
6. Reflect — run /reflect, update .claude if needed

Begin now by reading the state files.
