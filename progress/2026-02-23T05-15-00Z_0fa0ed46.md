# Progress: 2026-02-23T05:15Z — Session 0fa0ed46

**Type**: review (dead code removal)
**Issue**: #10 — Remove dead code: readBitsMSB, decodeBytes, finalize

## What was done

Removed three confirmed dead definitions:

1. `readBitsMSB` from `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean` — only self-referencing (recursive), never called
2. `decodeBytes` from `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean` — only referenced in a doc comment
3. `finalize` from `Zip/Spec/Crc32.lean` — zero references, implementation uses inline XOR

Also updated:
- Doc comment in `InflateCorrect.lean` that mentioned `decodeBytes`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` to remove `readBitsMSB` mention

## Verification

- `lake build Zip` passes (27 jobs)
- Sorry count: 0 → 0 (unchanged)
- `grep -r readBitsMSB Zip/` — no matches
- `grep -r decodeBytes Zip/` — no matches
- `grep -r 'def finalize' Zip/` — no matches

## Notes

- Test executable link fails due to missing zstd library (pre-existing issue, not related to this change)
- Net: 23 lines removed, 2 lines added
