# Progress: 2026-02-25T08:07:01Z — feature session 9f94d6fe

## Claimed issue
#285 — Port hendPos_tight to ZlibCorrect (4→3 sorrys)

## Accomplished
- Extended `ZlibEncode.compress_eq` to include `trailer.size = 4` in the existential
- Filled the `hendPos_tight` sorry in `zlib_decompressSingle_compress` by porting
  the proven GzipCorrect strategy: decompose compress, run inflateRaw_complete on
  header ++ deflated (no trailer), use inflateRaw_endPos_le + inflateRaw_append_suffix
  + injectivity to get the tight bound
- Updated the `obtain` destructuring at the existing compress_eq call site

## Key decisions
- Direct mechanical port of GzipCorrect lines 1381-1411, adapted for zlib's
  constants (header=2, trailer=4 vs gzip's header=10, trailer=8)
- No new lemmas needed — all infrastructure (inflateRaw_endPos_le,
  inflateRaw_append_suffix, inflateRaw_complete) already available from GzipCorrect

## Sorry count
- Before: 4 (GzipCorrect: 2, ZlibCorrect: 2)
- After: 3 (GzipCorrect: 2, ZlibCorrect: 1)
- Remaining in ZlibCorrect: `hadler` (Adler32 trailer match)

## What remains
- Issue #286 (blocked on this) can now be unblocked: prove endPos exactness + fill final 3 sorrys
