# Progress: Add fuel independence theorem statements

- **Date**: 2026-02-23T05:26Z
- **Session type**: implementation (worker)
- **Issue**: #15

## What was done

Added three fuel independence theorem statements to `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean`
(all with `sorry`):

1. `decodeSymbols_fuel_independent` — if `decodeSymbols` succeeds with
   some fuel, it returns the same result with any additional fuel
2. `decodeCLSymbols_fuel_independent` — same for `decodeDynamicTables.decodeCLSymbols`
3. `decode_fuel_independent` — same for `decode`

These prove the spec decode is well-defined: results depend only on the
input bitstream, not the arbitrary fuel parameter.

## Decisions

- Added to `Deflate.lean` (475 → 504 lines) rather than a new file,
  since it stays well under the 800-line threshold
- `decodeCLSymbols` was accessible as `decodeDynamicTables.decodeCLSymbols`
  without needing promotion — `where` clause is externally referenceable
- Stated `decode_fuel_independent` for `decode` directly (not `decode.go`);
  the `go` helper lemma will be needed during the proof phase

## Sorry count

- Before: 0
- After: 3 (the three new theorem statements)

## What remains

- Proofs for all three theorems (dependent issue to be created)
- The proofs will likely need helper lemmas about `decode.go`
