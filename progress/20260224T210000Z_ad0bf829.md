# Progress: Split DeflateDynamicCorrect.lean

**Date**: 2026-02-24T21:00:00Z
**Session**: ad0bf829
**Type**: review (file splitting)
**Issue**: #229

## What was done

Split `Zip/Spec/DeflateDynamicCorrect.lean` (809 lines) into two files:

- **`Zip/Spec/DeflateDynamicFreqs.lean`** (374 lines): All 13 tokenFreqs
  property theorems, changed from `private` to `protected`
- **`Zip/Spec/DeflateDynamicCorrect.lean`** (458 lines): `deflateDynamic_spec`
  and `inflate_deflateDynamic`

Both files are now well under the 500-line threshold.

## Decisions

- Used `protected` (not public) for extracted theorems since they're
  internal helpers consumed only by DeflateDynamicCorrect.lean
- Recursive self-references within DeflateDynamicFreqs.lean use
  `Deflate.theorem_name` (fully qualified within namespace)
- The new file imports `DeflateDynamic` (for `tokenFreqs` definition)
  and `EmitTokensCorrect` (for `nativeFindLengthCode_idx_bound` etc.)

## Sorry count

- Start: 1
- End: 1
- Delta: 0

## What remains

Nothing — all deliverables completed.
