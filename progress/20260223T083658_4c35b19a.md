# Progress: Fix PR #56 merge conflicts

**Date**: 2026-02-23T08:36 UTC
**Session**: 4c35b19a (worker — implementation/maintenance)
**Issue**: #60

## What was done

Rebased PR #56 (`agent/9c187399`) onto current master to resolve merge
conflicts. The PR implements the `encodeLitLen_decodeLitLen` reference
case proof (closing issue #37).

### Conflict resolution

Only `.claude/CLAUDE.md` had a conflict — both master and the PR branch
had added different proof strategy entries to the same section. Resolved
by keeping all entries from both sides:
- Master's entries: fuel independence proof pattern, avoid do-if-return
- PR's entries: simp for Option match chains, letFun linter false positive

`Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean` (the main code change) rebased cleanly with no
conflicts.

### Verification

- `lake build`: passed (118 jobs)
- `lake exe test`: all tests passed
- Sorry count: 2 (down from 3 on master — the encodeLitLen reference
  case sorry is eliminated by PR #56's proof)
  - Remaining sorries: 2 in `Zip/Spec/LZ77NativeCorrect.lean`
- PR #56 status: MERGEABLE with auto-merge enabled, waiting for CI

## Decisions

- Force-pushed the rebased branch with `--force-with-lease`
- No new code changes needed — pure conflict resolution

## What remains

- PR #56 CI should pass and auto-merge
- This unblocks issue #51 (split Deflate.lean) which depends on #37
