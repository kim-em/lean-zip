# Progress: Split DeflateEncode.lean

- **Date**: 2026-02-23 09:45 UTC
- **Session**: aa755f72 (worker, review/file-organization)
- **Issue**: #77

## What was done

Split `Zip/Spec/DeflateEncode.lean` (1168 lines, over 1000-line limit)
into two files:

- `DeflateEncode.lean` (820 lines): core encode infrastructure — symbol
  encoding functions, roundtrip proofs, success proofs, fixed table
  properties
- `Zip/Spec/LZ77Lazy.lean` (367 lines): LZ77→encode bridge proofs
  (`matchLZ77_encodable`, `matchLZ77_validSymbolList`, `matchLZ77_length_le`,
  `deflateLevel1_spec_roundtrip`, `deflateLevel1_spec_roundtrip'`) plus
  all `matchLZ77Lazy` definitions and `deflateLevel2_spec_roundtrip`

Updated `Zip.lean` with the new import and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` source
layout table.

## Verification

- `lake build` passes (128 jobs)
- `lake exe test` passes (all tests)
- Sorry count unchanged: 15 (4 HuffmanEncode, 6 DeflateFixedCorrect,
  5 DeflateStoredCorrect)
- No downstream import changes needed (moved definitions were only
  referenced within DeflateEncode.lean itself)

## Sorry delta

Before: 15, After: 15 (no change)
