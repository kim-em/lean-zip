# Progress: Fix merge conflicts on PR #166

**Date**: 2026-02-24T07:30Z
**Session**: e9c7ce3b (worker — PR maintenance)
**Issue**: #167

## What was done

Rebased PR #166 (`agent/fbe53e12`) onto current master, resolving all
merge conflicts. The branch had 9 commits, of which:

- 2 were auto-skipped by `git rebase` (readCLCodeLengths_complete and
  planner lock fix — already merged via earlier PRs)
- 1 was skipped (DeflateFixedCorrect split — already merged via PR #154)
- 1 was dropped as empty (progress entry for the split)
- 2 were skipped/resolved (decode_go_complete and huffTree_decode_complete
  — already merged via PR #164)
- 3 survived the rebase (the truly new work: decodeHuffman_complete
  literal/endOfBlock cases, decodeLitLen_reference_inv helper, progress
  entry)

Post-rebase fix: the call to `huffTree_decode_complete` had an extra
`(by omega)` argument because the branch's version had an additional
`hmb20 : maxBits ≤ 20` parameter that master's version (from PR #164)
doesn't have. Removed the extra argument.

PR #164 was already merged (commit 308b19c), so no need to close it.
Issue #165 was already closed.

## Verification

- `lake build`: passes (150 jobs)
- `lake exe test`: all tests passed
- Sorry count: 7 (unchanged from master — the partial proof in
  DecodeCorrect reduces the `sorry` to just the reference case)
- PR #166 is MERGEABLE with auto-merge enabled

## Sorry count (7 total)
