**Session type**: review (documentation)
**Issue**: #212 — Update PROGRESS.md and CLAUDE.md for zero-sorry milestone

## Accomplished

- Updated PROGRESS.md:
  - Phase 4 status: "in progress" → "complete"
  - Session count: ~120 → ~130 (132 progress files)
  - Added missing completions: `deflateDynamic_spec`, `writeDynamicHeader_spec`,
    `computeCodeLengths_nonzero`
  - Documented all file splits (DecodeCorrect, InflateCorrect, Deflate,
    HuffmanCorrect, DeflateDynamicCorrect)
  - Listed proof quality review sessions
  - Replaced "Remaining sorries" section with clean "Zero sorries" statement
- Audited `.claude/CLAUDE.md` source layout table — already up-to-date,
  no changes needed

## Verification

- `lake build`: 172/172 jobs, all pass
- `grep -rc sorry Zip/`: 0
- Source layout diff: empty (all files match)

## Sorry count delta

Before: 0 → After: 0 (no code changes)
