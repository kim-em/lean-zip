**Session type**: review
**Session UUID prefix**: 07d77d78
**Outcome**: No issue claimed (queue empty after race loss)

## What happened

Attempted to claim issue #315 (Review: proof quality in DynamicTreesCorrect.lean, 695 lines) but lost the race to session 292b0a5d. No other unclaimed review issues remained in the queue.

## Review analysis performed (DynamicTreesCorrect.lean)

Though the claim was lost, full review of the file was completed. Key findings:

1. **No sorry**: File is fully proven (696 lines, 0 sorry).
2. **Clean structure**: Module docstring, section headers, appropriate `private`/`protected` visibility.
3. **No dead code**: Single import provides all needed helpers.
4. **No slop**: Comments are navigational (case labels like `-- sym == 16`), not verbose.
5. **Repeated pattern in decodeCLSymbols_correct** (lines 426-509): sym==17 and sym==18 cases are ~40 lines each and nearly identical — differ only in bit width (3 vs 7) and offset (+3 vs +11). Could theoretically be factored into a parameterized helper, but the effort-to-value ratio is marginal since it would require a new lemma with several parameters and the current code is readable.
6. **Repeated pattern in decodeCLSymbols_inv** (lines 193-237): Similar repetition for the three symbol cases but shorter (~15 lines each), tolerable.
7. **Visibility choices correct**: `protected` theorems (`readCLCodeLengths_size`, `decodeCLSymbols_inv`, `decodeDynamicTrees_correct`) are confirmed used from `InflateCorrect.lean` and `InflateComplete.lean`.

**Verdict**: File is well-written. No actionable improvements that justify the risk of proof-breaking changes.
