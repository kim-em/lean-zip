# Progress: Fix PR #34 merge conflicts

**Date**: 2026-02-23 09:45 UTC
**Session**: 0cdc6a4c (worker — PR fix)
**Issue**: #40

## What was done

Rebased PR #34 (`agent/cb09159b`) onto current master to resolve merge
conflicts. The PR proves all 3 fuel independence theorems for the DEFLATE
spec, eliminating 3 sorries from `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean`.

### Conflict resolution

Only one file had conflicts: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The conflict was in
the Proof Strategies section — master had added 3 new entries
(`List.getElem_of_eq`, `Nat.mod_eq_sub_mod`, `set` is Mathlib-only)
while PR #34 added 2 entries (fuel independence proof pattern, avoid
`do { if ... then return ...; rest }`). Resolution: keep all 5 entries.

The main code file (`Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean`) rebased cleanly — the fuel
independence proofs are in a separate section from the BB1/BB2 additions.

### Verification

- `lake build` — full build passes (112 jobs)
- `lake exe test` — all tests pass
- Sorry count: 6 → 3 (fuel independence sorries eliminated)
- Remaining sorries in `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean`: `encodeLitLen_correct`
  (line 555) and `decode_encodeStored` (line 818)
- PR #34 now shows as MERGEABLE on GitHub

## Decisions

- Kept PR #34's refactoring of `decodeCLSymbols` from `where` clause
  to standalone `def` (rebased cleanly, master still had `where`)
- No code changes needed beyond the CLAUDE.md conflict resolution

## Sorry count

- Start: 6 (all in `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean`)
- End: 3 (fuel independence proofs complete, encoding roundtrips remain)
