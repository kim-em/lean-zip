# Progress: Resolve merge conflicts on PR #68

**Date**: 2026-02-23T09:14Z
**Session type**: implementation (PR maintenance)
**Issue**: #73

## What was accomplished

Rebased PR #68 (`agent/e2e595ec`) onto current master (`62faf46`),
resolving merge conflicts in two files:

1. **`Zip.lean`**: Added `import Zip.Spec.DeflateStoredCorrect` alongside
   master's new `import Zip.Spec.DeflateFixedCorrect` (from PR #72).

2. **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`**: Merged proof strategy entries from both sides —
   master had added `simp`/`letFun`/UInt8/Nat entries; the PR had added
   `generalize`/`Bool.false_eq_true`/`Bool vs Prop` entries. Kept all.

No API breakage was found — `DeflateStoredCorrect.lean` compiled cleanly
against current master without any code changes.

## Verification

- `lake build`: 124 jobs, all successful
- `lake exe test`: all tests passed
- Sorry count: 6 in `DeflateFixedCorrect.lean` + 5 in
  `DeflateStoredCorrect.lean` (both pre-existing, no regression)
- PR #68 now shows `MERGEABLE` on GitHub, CI triggered

## What remains

- PR #68 CI needs to pass (triggered by the force-push)
- The 5 sorries in `DeflateStoredCorrect.lean` are intentional WIP
  from the original PR — filling them is a separate work item
