# Progress: Fix merge conflicts on PR #81 (RLE encoding)

**Date**: 2026-02-23T10:58:12Z
**Session**: df7c4947
**Type**: implementation (PR attention)
**Issue**: #86

## What was done

Rebased PR #81 (`agent/18fedd5d`) on current master to resolve merge conflicts
in `Zip/Spec/DeflateEncode.lean`.

The conflict was caused by PR #80 which split `DeflateEncode.lean` — moving
matchLZ77 bridge proofs and matchLZ77Lazy definitions to `Zip/Spec/LZ77Lazy.lean`.
PR #81's branch pre-dated that split, so it contained the full pre-split file
plus the new RLE encoding code.

Resolution: kept the master (post-split) version of DeflateEncode.lean and
appended only the new RLE encoding code (CLEntry, countRun, rlEncodeLengths,
rlDecodeLengths, and all associated proofs). Dropped the matchLZ77/matchLZ77Lazy
code that now lives in LZ77Lazy.lean.

## Verification

- `lake build`: passes (128 jobs)
- `lake exe test`: all tests passed
- Sorry count: 11 (unchanged — 1 HuffmanEncode, 5 DeflateFixedCorrect, 5 DeflateStoredCorrect)
- PR #81 status: MERGEABLE on GitHub
- No theorem statements changed

## File changes

- `Zip/Spec/DeflateEncode.lean`: 820 → 1115 lines (RLE code added to post-split file)

## What remains

- PR #81 needs CI to pass, then auto-merge will squash-merge it
- Once merged, issue #66 closes, unblocking issue #71 (encodeDynamicTrees)
