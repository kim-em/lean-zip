# Progress: Update PROGRESS.md for Phase 4+ (summarize session)

**Date**: 2026-02-25 00:06 UTC
**Session**: 596bdda8 (summarize)
**Issue**: #251

## What changed

Updated PROGRESS.md to accurately reflect post-Phase 4 state:

1. **Phase**: Changed from "Phase 4 complete" to "Phase 4+" (gzip/zlib
   framing roundtrip proofs in progress)
2. **Sorry count**: Corrected from 0 to 10 (8 GzipCorrect, 2 ZlibCorrect)
3. **Session count**: Updated from ~130 to ~148
4. **Added statistics**: 81 source files, 113 merged PRs
5. **Added Phase 4+ section**: Documents gzip/zlib framing roundtrip work,
   target theorems, what's proved vs sorry, and the dependency chain
6. **Phase 3 updates**: Added fuel independence and fromLengths_valid
   (both proved, were listed as TODO in the previous version)
7. **Phase 4 restructured**: Organized by building block (BB1–BB4),
   explicitly noted the capstone theorem's 5MB size bound and its
   limitation (raw DEFLATE only, not framing)
8. **Sorry inventory**: Detailed table of all 10 sorries with what
   each proves and why it's needed

## Key finding

All 10 sorries are blocked on a single infrastructure problem:
`inflateLoop_endPos_le` (proving endPos ≤ data.size after the inflate
loop). This requires threading BitReader invariants through all decode
operations. 6 of 10 `_inv` lemmas are proved; 4 remain sorry'd.

## VERIFICATION.md note

VERIFICATION.md Phase 3 has two stale TODOs that are actually done:
- "TODO: Fuel independence of spec decode" → proved as `decode_fuel_independent` in DeflateFuelIndep.lean
- "TODO: `fromLengths` success implies `ValidLengths`" → proved as `fromLengths_valid` in DynamicTreesCorrect.lean

VERIFICATION.md is a protected file — noting for maintainer to update manually.

## Sorry count delta
- Start: 10
- End: 10
- Delta: 0 (documentation-only session)
