# Progress: Review — PROGRESS.md + CLAUDE.md audit

- **Date**: 2026-02-24T22:00Z
- **Session**: e9c7ce3b (worker, issue #126)
- **Session type**: Review (documentation accuracy)
- **Starting commit**: ae1e754

## What was done

### Deliverable 1: Update PROGRESS.md sorry inventory
Corrected the sorry inventory from 9 sorries in 3 files to 12 sorries
in 4 files:

- `BitstreamCorrect.lean` (2): readUInt16LE_complete, readBytes_complete
  (readBits_complete was proved in a prior session on this branch)
- `DecodeCorrect.lean` (3): decodeStored_complete, huffTree_decode_complete,
  decodeHuffman_complete
- `InflateCorrect.lean` (2): decodeDynamicTrees_complete, inflateLoop_complete
- `DeflateFixedCorrect.lean` (4): deflateFixed_spec, inflate_deflateFixed,
  inflate_deflateLazy, inflate_deflateDynamic

Removed stale entries:
- DeflateStoredCorrect.lean: all 3 sorries proved (fromLengths_fixedLit_ok,
  fromLengths_fixedDist_ok, inflate_deflateStoredPure)
- DeflateEncodeDynamic.lean: 1 sorry proved (encodeDynamicTrees_decodeDynamicTables)
- DeflateFixedCorrect.lean: emitTokens_spec and inflate_complete both proved

Updated "Completed" section with: stored-block roundtrip, lazy LZ77 correctness,
canonical codes correctness, dynamic tree roundtrip, emitTokens correspondence,
inflate_complete. Updated key gap description — now focuses on completeness
direction (spec → native) as the blocking work.

### Deliverable 2: Audit CLAUDE.md
Source layout table was missing 3 files:
- `Zip/Spec/Adler32.lean` — Adler-32 specification
- `Zip/Spec/Crc32.lean` — CRC-32 specification
- `Zip/Spec/HuffmanEncodeCorrect.lean` — Canonical codes correctness

No stale entries found in the Proof Strategies section. All patterns from
recent progress entries (Bool.false_eq_true, generalize before bv_decide,
let binding opacity, etc.) are already documented.

### Deliverable 3: Update session statistics
Updated toolchain from rc1 to rc2. Updated session count from 69 to ~90.

## Sorry count
- Start: 11 (after rebase onto readBits_complete proof)
- End: 11 (no code changes, documentation only)

## Decisions
- The issue predicted 8 sorries but actual count is 11 (12 on master,
  minus 1 readBits_complete proved on this branch). The difference from
  the plan is due to inflate_complete decomposition into completeness
  sub-lemmas (net +7) partially offset by resolved sorries (-5).
