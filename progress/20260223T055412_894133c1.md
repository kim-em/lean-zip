# Progress: Fix PR #21 merge conflicts

**Date**: 2026-02-23 05:54 UTC
**Session type**: implementation (PR fix)
**Issue**: #23

## What was done

- Claimed issue #23 (fix PR #21 merge conflicts)
- Fetched and rebased `agent/9b72e738` branch onto `origin/master`
- Resolved merge conflict in `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean`:
  - Master added `/-! ## Correctness theorems -/` section with
    `encodeStored_decode` theorem
  - PR #21 added `/-! ## Fuel independence -/` section with three
    fuel independence theorem statements
  - Resolution: placed fuel independence section first, then
    correctness theorems section — both coexist cleanly
- Verified `lake build Zip` passes (28 jobs, 4 expected sorry warnings)
- Force pushed rebased branch with `--force-with-lease`
- PR #21 is now MERGEABLE (no more conflicts)

## Sorry count

- Start: 1 (Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean)
- End: 4 (Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean) — 3 fuel independence + 1 encodeStored_decode
- Delta: +3 (from the PR's new theorem statements, not from this session)

## Notes

- Test executable (`lake exe test`) can't link in this worktree due to
  missing zstd library — pre-existing environment issue, not related to
  this change. The Lean library itself builds cleanly.
- PR merge state shows BLOCKED (waiting for CI), which is expected after
  force push.
