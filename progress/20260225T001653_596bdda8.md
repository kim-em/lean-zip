## Issue
#246 — Add module docstrings to all source files

## Accomplished
- Added `/-!` module-level docstrings to 36 files across `Zip/`, `ZipTest/`, and `Zip/Spec/`
- Converted 7 existing `/-` block comments in `Zip/Native/` and `Zip/Spec/` to `/-!` module docstrings
- Reviewed all 30+ existing docstrings for accuracy — all were current
- All 68+ source files now have module docstrings
- Build and all tests pass

## Decisions
- Docstrings placed after `import` statements (Lean 4 requires imports at file start)
- For files without imports, docstrings placed before `namespace` or first definition
- Kept docstrings concise (1-3 sentences) following existing style

## Sorry count
No change (still 4 sorry placeholders in GzipCorrect/ZlibCorrect — gzip/zlib framing proofs WIP)
