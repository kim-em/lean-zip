# 2026-02-22: Review — InflateCorrect proof quality + spec correspondence

**Starting commit**: `4c28a9f` | **Sorry count**: 2 → 2 (unchanged)

**Focus**: Deep review of InflateCorrect.lean proof quality, Deflate.lean
spec ↔ native correspondence verification, dead code scan.

### Proof improvements (committed `42f20ad`)
- `huffTree_decode_correct`: replaced bare `simp` with `simp only [Option.map]`
- `decodeHuffman_correct` literal case: combined two `rw` steps by folding
  `sym.toUInt8 = sym.toNat.toUInt8` (which is `rfl`) into the intermediate `have`

### Visibility changes (committed `f54ca51`)
- Made DEFLATE tables (lengthBase, lengthExtra, distBase, distExtra) public
  (was `private`) — needed for length/distance case of `decodeHuffman_correct`
- Note: `protected` doesn't work here because it requires fully-qualified
  names even within the same namespace

### Spec ↔ native correspondence (verified)
- All table values match (lengthBase, lengthExtra, distBase, distExtra,
  codeLengthOrder, fixedLitLengths, fixedDistLengths)
- Cross-block reference handling correct in both (acc passed through)
- decodeStored, decodeDynamicTables, decodeLitLen all match
- No discrepancies found

### Dead code / slop scan
- No dead code across Spec/ and ZipForStd/
- No unused imports
- Unused spec theorems are intentional infrastructure
- All private helpers used internally

### Decisions
- Used public (no modifier) instead of `protected` for tables — `protected`
  requires fully-qualified names even within the namespace
- Toolchain v4.29.0-rc1 still latest
