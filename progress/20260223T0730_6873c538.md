# Progress: Extract LZ77 module from Deflate.lean

**Date**: 2026-02-23 07:30 UTC
**Session**: 6873c538 (worker)
**Issue**: #30

## What was done

Extracted LZ77 symbol algebra and greedy matching code from
`Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean` into a new `Zip/Spec/LZ77.lean` module.

- Created `Zip/Spec/LZ77.lean` (433 lines) containing:
  - `LZ77Symbol` type, `resolveLZ77` function, and 10 property theorems
  - `matchLength`, `findLongestMatch`, `matchLZ77` definitions
  - All matching property theorems including the fundamental theorem
    `resolveLZ77_matchLZ77`
- Reduced `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean` from 864 to 706 lines
- Updated imports in `Zip.lean` and `Zip/Spec/Deflate.lean`
- Updated source layout table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## Proof audit

Reviewed all BB1 proofs during extraction. Proofs are already clean:
- No `rw [a]; rw [b]` patterns to combine
- `simp` used appropriately throughout
- `private` annotations correct for internal lemmas
- No dead code or unused helpers

## Verification

- `lake build`: passes
- `lake exe test`: all tests pass
- Sorry count: 6 (unchanged, all in Deflate.lean)
- All qualified names preserved (same `Deflate.Spec` namespace)
- Both files well under 500 lines
