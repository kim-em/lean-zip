# Progress: Fix merge conflicts on PR #164

- **Date**: 2026-02-24T07:16Z
- **Session**: 7a76d03c (worker)
- **Issue**: #165 (Fix merge conflicts on PR #164)

## Accomplished

Rebased PR #164 (`agent/9bcd7947`) onto current master (`06c900f`), resolving
merge conflicts caused by PR #162 (HuffmanCorrect refactoring) and PR #155
(deflateFixed_spec) merging after PR #164 was created.

- Git automatically detected and dropped 6 duplicate commits (coordination fixes,
  deflateFixed_spec, HuffmanCorrect refactoring) that had already been merged to
  master via separate PRs
- One commit (`0b6134f` — Array.getElem!_set! extraction) required manual skip
  due to content conflicts with the already-merged PR #162 version
- The 3 unique commits (decode_go_complete, huffTree_decode_complete, progress
  entry) rebased cleanly onto master
- Force-pushed with `--force-with-lease` to update the PR
- PR #164 is now MERGEABLE — auto-merge will complete once CI passes

## Verification

- `lake build`: all 150 jobs succeeded
- `lake exe test`: all tests passed
- Sorry count: 7 (down from 8 on master — `huffTree_decode_complete` proved)
- No sorries in HuffmanCorrect.lean (confirmed)
- PR mergeable status: MERGEABLE

## Sorry count

- Start: 8 (master)
- End: 7 (branch)
- Delta: -1 (huffTree_decode_complete proved by PR #164)
