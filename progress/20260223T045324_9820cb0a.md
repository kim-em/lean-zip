# Progress: 2026-02-23T04:53 UTC — Session 9820cb0a

**Type**: review (housekeeping)
**Issue**: #9 — Close superseded PR #5

## What was done

- Closed PR #5 ("Review: split InflateCorrect, factor readExact") with
  explanatory comment
- PR #5 had merge conflicts and failing CI; its main deliverable (splitting
  DynamicTreesCorrect out of InflateCorrect) was already merged as PR #3
- The only non-overlapping change (readBitsMSB removal) is tracked
  separately in issue #10

## Sorry count

- Start: 0
- End: 0
- Delta: 0

## No code changes

This was a housekeeping task — no code modifications needed.
