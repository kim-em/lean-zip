# Progress Entry — 2026-02-26T04:00:00Z

**Session**: cc07efa9 (summarize)
**Issue**: #274 — Summarize: update PROGRESS.md for 10 merged PRs

## What Changed

Updated PROGRESS.md to reflect 24 merged PRs since last summarize (#251,
closed 2026-02-25T00:07:24Z). Key corrections:

### Sorry count: 10 → 1
The Phase 4+ sorry table listed 10 sorries (8 GzipCorrect, 2 ZlibCorrect).
All 10 were resolved across PRs #259, #281, #287, #290, #295, #300.
The single remaining sorry is in `deflateRaw_goR_pad` (stored block case,
DeflateRoundtrip.lean) — a helper for `inflateRaw_endPos_eq` that does
not affect the core roundtrip theorems for levels 1–9.

### Size bound: 5MB → 500MB
PR #265 raised the bound 100x. Per-path bounds documented:
stored 655MB, fixed 1GB, lazy 500MB, dynamic 500MB.

### Phase 4+ marked complete
Both gzip and zlib framing roundtrip theorems are fully proved (0 sorries).
GzipCorrect.lean was split from 1949 lines into 4 focused modules (PR #303).

### New sections
- Track C1 (size bound improvement) — complete
- Track D (benchmarking) — started, with iterative LZ77 fix for stack overflow
- Updated statistics: 173 sessions, 138 PRs, 85 source files

## Decisions

- Marked Phase 4+ as "complete" rather than "in progress" since both
  capstone theorems have zero sorries. The remaining 1 sorry is in a
  helper theorem that doesn't block any top-level result.
- Kept Track C1 and Track D as separate subsections rather than folding
  into Phase 4, since they correspond to distinct tracks in PLAN.md.
- Updated review session count to ~82 based on grep of progress entries.

## What Remains

- 1 sorry: `deflateRaw_goR_pad` stored block case
- Track C2: eliminate fuel entirely (well-founded recursion)
- Track D: expand benchmarks, profile, optimize
- Track E: Zstd (not yet started)
