  LSB-first bit packer for DEFLATE streams.

  DEFLATE (RFC 1951) packs bits LSB-first within each byte.
  This module provides a stateful writer that accumulates bits
  into a wide pending buffer, flushing complete bytes to a ByteArray.

  Fields are packed in bulk: a whole `writeBits`/`writeHuffCode` field is
  merged into the 64-bit pending accumulator (`bitBuf`) in one shift/OR. Rather
  than flush every completed byte immediately (one `pushUInt64LE` FFI store per
  field — the dominant emit cost once the per-bit loop was removed, #2631), the
  writer **holds up to 31 pending bits** and flushes whole bytes only when the
  pending count reaches `flushThreshold` (32). One store then drains 4–7 bytes
  at once, cutting the FFI store count on a literal-heavy stream ~4× (measured
  ~+22-29% on the dynamic emit walk, ~+7-8% on full L1 — #2734). This is
  byte-identical to flushing every field: `toBits` (hence `bitLength` and the
  final `flush` output) depends only on the total bit sequence, not on when
  whole bytes are drained to `data`.
-/
namespace Zip.Native

/-- Pending-bit count at or above which whole bytes are drained to `data`.
    Below it, bits stay in the `bitBuf` accumulator (batched). At most one field
    (`≤ 25` bits) is added before the check, and the pre-check count is `< 32`,
    so the accumulator never exceeds `31 + 25 = 56 < 64` bits. -/

    Logically identical to `empty` (`emptyWithCapacity_eq` — capacity is
    runtime-only state, invisible to the model), but a writer that knows its
    flushed byte count in advance (the sized-prep dispatch does) can seed the
    exact capacity and skip every growth-doubling `ByteArray` copy — on
    Silesia-sized streams those reallocations were ~11% of compress-side minor
    page faults (memmove of ~2× the output). -/

/-- Total number of bits written so far: 8 per fully flushed byte in `data`
    plus the `bitCount` bits held in the partial byte. Used by the DEFLATE
    compressor to size a block (`⌈bitLength/8⌉` bytes after `flush`) without
    materialising it. -/
def bitLength (bw : BitWriter) : Nat := bw.data.size * 8 + bw.bitCount.toNat

/-- Flush whole bytes out of a wide accumulator `acc` holding `total` valid
    low bits, LSB-first. Pushes `total / 8` bytes to `data`; the remaining
    `total % 8` bits become the new partial byte.

    Reference form only: the production writers use the split scalar
    `flushBytesWideU`/`dropBytesU` forms (equal by `flushAcc_eq` via
    `flushBatchedU_eq`, which the `writeBits_def`/`writeHuffCode_def`
    equations build on) so the `BitWriter` cell is constructed in the caller,
    where the ctor-reuse optimization can recycle the input writer instead of
    allocating a fresh cell per field (measured at ~59%/~19% of

/-! ### Scalar-arithmetic flush kernel (#2827)

The writers run once per DEFLATE field — the hottest call sites in compress
(11–17% of L1 between `writeHuffCode`/`writeBits` self time). The reference
forms above do the per-field bookkeeping in `Nat` (`total`, `total / 8`,
`total % 8`, the `dropBytes` recursion), which the compiler emits as tagged
`lean_nat_*` calls plus an out-of-line `dropBytes` loop on every flush. The
`*U` forms below do the same arithmetic in `UInt32`/`UInt64` registers —
`total` fits `UInt32` exactly (`bitCount, len < 256`, so `total < 512`),
`/ 8` is `>>> 3`, `% 8` is `&&& 7`, and `dropBytes` collapses to one shift
(`dropBytesU_eq`). Each is proven equal to its reference form, so
`writeBits_def`/`writeHuffCode_def` (the equations all spec proofs anchor on)
keep their exact statements. -/

/-- `dropBytes` as a single shift: `k` byte-shifts of a 64-bit accumulator is
    `>>> 8k` for `k < 8` and `0` once every byte has been shifted out
    (`dropBytesU_eq`). Deliberately *not* `@[inline]`: inlining its branch
    into the writers' flush arm makes the ctor-reuse pass pick the flush-arm
    join as the sole reuse site, demoting the hot no-flush arm to
    free-then-alloc (measured −13% on dickens L1). As an out-call (like the
    old `dropBytes`) both writer arms keep in-place reuse. -/
