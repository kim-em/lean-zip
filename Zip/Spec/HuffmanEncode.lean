# Huffman Code Length Computation from Symbol Frequencies

Spec-level algorithm for computing optimal Huffman code lengths from symbol
frequencies. This is the encoding direction: given how often each symbol
appears, determine the bit length of each symbol's codeword.

The algorithm:
1. Create leaf nodes for symbols with frequency > 0
2. Repeatedly merge the two lightest nodes (standard Huffman construction)
3. Extract code depths from the resulting tree
4. Limit depths to `maxBits` (15 for DEFLATE)

The key correctness property is that the computed lengths satisfy
`Huffman.Spec.ValidLengths`, ensuring the canonical construction produces
a valid prefix-free code.

Definitions and types for the canonical code construction (from given lengths)
are in `Zip.Spec.Huffman`. Property theorems are in `Zip.Spec.HuffmanTheorems`.

/-- The computed code lengths satisfy `ValidLengths`.

    The proof establishes:
    - Length bound: capping at `maxBits` ensures all lengths ≤ maxBits
    - Kraft inequality: a binary tree's leaves satisfy the Kraft equality;
      `assignLengths` can only reduce the number of nonzero entries (if
      duplicate symbols exist), preserving the inequality

    The Kraft equality for binary trees is proved (`BuildTree.kraft_eq`).
    What remains sorry'd is the plumbing connecting the tree's Kraft sum
    to the `ValidLengths` definition through `assignLengths` and depth
    capping. Specifically:
    1. `assignLengths` may drop or overwrite entries, so its Kraft sum
       is ≤ the tree's Kraft sum (need `foldl_set` Kraft lemma)
    2. Capping depths at maxBits can increase individual Kraft contributions
       (need monotonicity of 2^(D-d) in d)
    3. Connecting the filtered foldl in `ValidLengths` to `kraftSum`

    For typical DEFLATE inputs (≤ 286 symbols), tree depth is ≤ 9,
    well under maxBits = 15, so the cap is a no-op. -/
