# Huffman Tree Primitives

Core definitions and proofs for Huffman tree correctness:
- `decodeBits`: pure tree decode on bit lists
- `decode_go_decodeBits`: BitReader decode ↔ `decodeBits` correspondence
- `TreeHasLeaf`: inductive predicate for tree-path-symbol relationships
- `insert.go` correctness: `insert_go_hasLeaf`, `insert_go_preserves`,
  `insert_go_noLeafOnPath`, `insert_go_complete'`

The `fromLengths` loop invariants and main theorems are in `HuffmanCorrectLoop`.

/-! ### Tree-table correspondence via TreeHasLeaf

The proof that `decodeBits` agrees with `Huffman.Spec.decode` is structured
in layers:
1. **TreeHasLeaf**: inductive predicate relating tree paths to symbols
2. **decodeBits ↔ TreeHasLeaf**: structural correspondence
3. **insert creates correct paths**: `insert.go` places leaves correctly
4. **fromLengths establishes all paths**: the construction loop builds
   leaves for all canonical codes
5. **Final connection**: via `decode_prefix_free` from Huffman.Spec -/

    where `false` means "go left (zero)" and `true` means "go right (one)". -/
